Codes that I developed to solve the proposed problems. As vezes em inglês ou em português



Problem 1:

Retrieve, using the noisy data from the GPS on the attached file, which images are on each of the orchard’s rows, classify the images according to the row and provide a method for visualizing the points on the map (a map overlay is not necessary).

Hint: Use Google Maps to visualize the orchard’s geometry.

 

Problem 2:

Using the Lunch Room Blue dataset, from http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/en/research/datasets/passta/, create an algorithm that generates a panoramic view of the room with the least possible number of dataset images.
